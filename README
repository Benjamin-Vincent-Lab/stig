INTRODUCTION

DATA FILES

1. TCR FASTA files were downloaded from the ImMunoGeneTics GENE-DB site
(www.imgt.org/genedb).  The datasets were chosen to include "nucleotide 
sequences for F+ORF+all P".  As of this writing, a description of the available
datasets can be found at http://www.imgt.org/genedb/directlinks

An example of these files can be found at:
http://www.imgt.org/genedb/GENElect?query=7.2+TRAV&species=Homo+sapiens

2. TCR segment descriptors (e.g. TRBV22-1 L & V-gene unit is on forward strand of 7q34 at
nucleotides 142641746->142642235) were copied from the "Localization in genome
assemblies" tables for the various TCR loci.  As of this writing, these can
be found at http://www.imgt.org/genedb/
