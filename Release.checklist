This is the checklist for releases.  It is intended to live in the develop branch, and is not for inclusion into final releases

PRIOR TO release-* BRANCH:
[] - All features/fixes on develop: Hotfix/feature related code and documentation changes, NOT including version number bumps
[] - Review files / features, as NO NEW FEATURES ONCE RELEASE BRANCH IS CREATED

[] - Apply any hotfixes, review documentation updates, and fix other issues here.  No new features.

BUMP RELEASE NUMBERS:
[] - ChangeLog updated with version number, release date, summary of changes
[] - doc/manual.md updated with version number
[] - add/commit version bump changes
